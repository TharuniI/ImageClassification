# ImageClassification

### Problem
How can we improve existing image classification models to effectively categorize objects in images into 10 unique labels?

### Approach
Through experimentalize studies, compare different styles, architectures, and variables of a model to determine the best results. Focusing on the activation function and optimizer, we will isolate these and determine the best of its kind after determining the best architectural style.

### Dataset
CIFAR10 - 60 000 images in total
