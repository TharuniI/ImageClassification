# ImageClassification

### Problem
How can we improve existing image classification models to effectively categorize objects in images into 10 unique labels?

### Approach
Through experimentalize studies, compare different styles, architectures, and variables of a model to determine the best results. Focusing on the activation function and optimizer, we will isolate these and determine the best of its kind after determining the best architectural style.

### Dataset
The data collected was a set of images utilized for image classification. The one used specifically for this project is the cifar-10 dataset, each image is coloured and of size 32 by 32, and are classified into one of the ten categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. Each classification consists of 6000 images, which is a total of 60 000 images, 50 000 of it split into a training dataset and 10 000 split into a testing dataset.
